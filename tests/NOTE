args/ contains various files sent to the demo programs

each other folder contains a test file.

test 0 - simple output to stdout
test 1 - input from stdin, and output to stdout
test 2 - input filename passed via argv, data sent to stdout 
test 3 - output filename passed via argv, data sent there in programs
test 4 - multiple tests in single .toml file

in vscode, cd to any testing directory, and refresh the workspace to 
initialize the diff-test extension. 

NB: Each Makefile builds the 'reference' for you automatically on 
building the program executable.
